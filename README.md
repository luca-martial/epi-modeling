# Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases: Simulating Impact of Vaccination Strategies on COVID-19 Disease Dynamics

The goal of this project was to examine the impact of vaccination strategies targeted at highly connected individuals compared to random general population vaccination, using a SIR compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 embedded onto a power law with cut-off human contact network in a closed population.

The notebook with all the code used to run all experiments can be found [here](https://github.com/luca-martial/epi-modeling/blob/main/vaccination_simulations.ipynb).
